![image](https://github.com/amguedes/amguedes.github.io/tree/master/img/smile-solid.svg") My name is Ana Guedes. I am a biologist turned data scientist looking to bring experience in analytical research to data-driven companies and deliver short-term impact.
I'll be posting ideas that I find interesting, learnings that I consider worth sharing and other miscellaneous topics, always related to data science! 


### Work
I started my data science journey in [S2DS](http://www.s2ds.org/), an excellent program to transform PhDs into business-desirable people. 
I have joined Royal Mail in 2016 and have been working as a data scientist. 


### Education
I finished my PhD in [Bioengineering Systems by MIT-Portugal Program](https://www.mitportugal.org/education/bioengineering-systems/doctoral-program) in 2016. In my thesis I focused on the analysis of the gene regulatory network underlying pluripotenciality in mouse embryonic stem cells. 


### Previous life
In a previous life I was interested in stem cell research and developmental biology, whith a special obsession on the transcription factor Nanog.
