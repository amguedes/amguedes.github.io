After a long time thinking about how to do it and which tools to use, here is my first blog post!


#### Who am I?
I am a trained biologist. I spent most of my PhD counting RNA molecules inside stem cells! 
During my PhD I started to learn R to do beautiful graphs with ggplot. One thing let to another and I started to learn more about R and started to be fascinated by Machine Learning. After finishing my PhD I decided to pursue a carrer as a data scientist. Learnt a lot on my own using all the well known resourses (MOOCs, coursera, datacamp, kaggle...). Did a bootcamp in London ([S2DS](http://www.s2ds.org/#course) and got my first job as a data scientist. Since then I have been continuously learning a lot both in Machine Learning and the ins and outs of how businesses work! 


#### Why am I blogging?
During the last 2 years I learnt so many things and many times that learning is not easy. It involves researching fragmented information and trying various tutorials. This blog is a way to share what I learnt in some of those investigations. 
Additionally, being in a business is very different from academia! I will share some of my experiences in the hope that they might be useful for others coming from a similar background. 


#### What will I blog about?
Pretty much anything related to data science. From coding to machine learning, models, soft skills and interesting topics. 


#### Who am I writting for?
Anyone in the data landscape. 


#### How can you get involved?
Please ask questions, make comments and correct me if I'm wrong!
